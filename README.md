Project Overview
This project uses YOLOv5 to detect custom objects based on a labeled dataset. The model has been fine-tuned with a unique dataset to achieve high accuracy in detecting specified objects. YOLOv5 is a state-of-the-art object detection model known for its speed and accuracy.

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Install YOLOv5 if you haven't already:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5
cd yolov5
pip install -r requirements.txt
Data Preparation
Labeling: Use a tool like LabelImg to label your images in YOLO format (text files with bounding box coordinates).

Organize Data: Structure the data directory as follows:

kotlin
Copy code
dataset/
├── images/
│   ├── train/
│   └── val/
└── labels/
    ├── train/
    └── val/
Configuration: Modify the data.yaml file to point to your dataset directory and define class names:

yaml
Copy code
train: dataset/images/train
val: dataset/images/val
nc: <number_of_classes>
names: [ 'class1', 'class2', ... ]
Training
To train the YOLOv5 model, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
python train.py --img 640 --batch 16 --epochs 100 --data data.yaml --weights yolov5s.pt --cache
Parameters:
--img: Input image size.
--batch: Batch size for training.
--epochs: Number of training epochs.
--data: Path to data.yaml.
--weights: Specify pretrained weights, e.g., yolov5s.pt for YOLOv5 small.
Evaluation
After training, evaluate the model to measure its performance on the validation set:

bash
Copy code
python val.py --data data.yaml --weights runs/train/exp/weights/best.pt --img 640
Inference
Run inference on custom images:

bash
Copy code
python detect.py --weights runs/train/exp/weights/best.pt --img 640 --source path/to/your/test/images
This will save predictions in the runs/detect directory.

Results
Visualize results using the detect.py script on sample images. Include metrics such as precision, recall, and mAP (mean Average Precision) in this section.
